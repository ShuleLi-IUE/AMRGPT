How many countries and areas were enrolled in GLASS-AMR?,"By the end of the 2021, 109 countries plus two territories and areas were enrolled in GLASS-AMR.",2
What are the strategic objectives of the global action plan (GAP) on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 2015?,"there are five main obejectives: to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training; to strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research; to reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures; to optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health; and to develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries and to increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.",2
How many countries have developed their own national action plan (NAP) on antimicrobial resistance (AMR)?,"Up to 2021-22, there are 149 countries released their own national action plan.",2
Which sector in One health would be influenced by antimicrobial resistance (AMR)?,"All sectors of One Health would be influenced by antimicrobial resistance. The sectors include human health, animal health, plant health, food systems, and the enviroment.",3
What is One Health?,"One Health is an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and the environment. ",1
What is antimicrobial resistance (AMR)?,"AMR occurs when microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi, become resistant to antimicrobial treatments to which they were previously susceptible. ",1
Is it still possible to control antimicrobial resistance (AMR)?,"Yes. But it requires multisectoral and multidisciplinary efforts in a One Health approach including responsible use of antimicrobials, surveillance, infection prevention and control, and developing new medicines and diagnostic tools.",5
What are the issues with financing in controlling AMR?,"The financing challenges associated with combating AMR are complex. Despite its significance, AMR competes for funds with other pressing global health issues like universal health coverage and health security. This competition hampers securing adequate investment for AMR initiatives. Most funding is directed towards new drug research and surveillance systems, often neglecting crucial areas like regulatory support and infection prevention. Also, many countries struggle to allocate funds or establish effective AMR plans due to fragmented implementation and weak coordination across sectors.",5
What is the status of MRSA infection in Europe?,"For S. aureus, a significant decrease in the EU/EEA (excluding the United Kingdom) population-weighted percentage of MRSA isolates was reported during 2017 to 2021, from 18.4% to 15.8%. Nevertheless, MRSA is still an important pathogen in the EU/EEA, with percentages remaining high in several countries, and it prevalence in the EU/EEA varies significantly, with a clear north to south/east gradient.",5
Which regions will be disproportionally affected by AMR?,"Low- and middle-income countries such as Africa, South Asia will be disproportionally affected by AMR. ",5
What are the options for strengthening AMR surveillance in developing countries?,Deepening engagement with global and regional networks;  establishing surveillance systems; enhancing laboratory capacity and adopting innovative surveillance approaches; multisectoral coordination in a One Health approach.,5
Where is the majority of handling AMR finance going?,"Much of finaicial support is used to fund research and development (R&D) for new drugs or to strengthening laboratory and surveillance systems, rather than, for example, supporting medicines regulators, updating treatment guidelines for doctors or veterinarians or strengthening systems for preventing infection.",5
Are there Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators in addressing AMR?,Yes.  It inculdes SDG indicator 3.d.2 and SDG indicator 3.d.3. SDG indicator 3.d.2 represents percentage of bloodstream infections due to selected antimicrobial-resistant organisms; and SDG indicator 3.d.3 represents proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis (where antibiotics will be disaggregated from the core set of data used in the metadata),3
Are there new emerging antimicrobial resistance pathogens or genes?,"Yes, new emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens and genes have been identified. In the UK, a novel mobile colistin resistance gene, mcr-8, has been found in NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Across Europe, Campylobacter spp. strains harboring the cfr gene have been reported. Additionally, the identification of the mcr-10 gene in Escherichia coli illustrates the ongoing emergence of colistin resistance genes.",5
Which countries monitor or plan to monitor the antimicrobial-resistance genes?,"Yes. For example, the USA planed to strengthen the implemention of whole-genome sequencing. In Europe, the monitoring of antibiotic resistance genes is included in the watch list programme as part of the proposal for revising the Water Framework Directive. In national action plan of Japan, the monitoring of antimicrobial-resistance genes is also listed as importany actions.",4
Which countries monitor or plan to monitor antimicrobial-resistant fungal infections?,"Guinea-Bissau, the UK, the USA, and Canada.",4
What antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections cause the highest mortality rates in Europe?,"Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant E. coli proportionally contribute most to the burden of AMR in the EU/EEA, both in terms of the number of cases and the number of attributable deaths.",3
Which antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections cause the bloodstream infections most often in Europe?,Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are major causes of bloodstream infection in Europe.,3
