It is estimated to cause around 700,000 deaths annually worldwide and could disrupt the global economy, potentially resulting in trillions of dollars in costs if left unaddressed. Nonetheless, the international response to AMR has been robust.', 'In UK, AMR is a global problem that impacts all countries and all people, regardless of their wealth or status.', '1. Introduction 1.1 Background AMR is a complex global challenge with significant implications for human health, social well-being and economic development.', 'In Malaysia, by the World Bank Group, without an effective AMR containment, it is predicted that the world will lose 3.8% of its annual GDP by 2050, with a yearly shortfall of USD 3.4 trillion by 2030. In addition, the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 ACHIEVEMENTS are less likely to be achieved. OF MyAP-AMR AMR occurs naturally over time through genetic changes.', 'In Kuwait, Around 2.4 million people could die in high-income countries between 2015 and 2050 without a sustained effort to contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR).1 The emergence of AMR is a complex problem driven by many interconnected factors, in particular the use and misuse of antimicrobials.', 'How can WHO meet this important challenge? 2) Should there be a dedicated team in the Ministry of Health to deal with AMR to ensure sustainability, routine programming, planning and budgeting by governments? 3) How do we further support stopping overuse and misuse of antimicrobials to decrease overall antimicrobial consumption?', 'In Malaysia, In order to minimise the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to maintain the effectiveness of these antimicrobials, an integrated approach using “One Health” concept is essential in addressing this issue. The Malaysian Action Plan on AMR (MyAP-AMR) has been developed involving multiple sectors and it addresses a wide range of activities required to tackle AMR problem effectively.', 'In Sweden, Lessons learned and future perspectives The challenges posed by AMR cannot be solved by individual countries alone.They require global cooperation, coherent measures and an enabling envi ronment. Progress in tackling AMR is typically greater in high-income than in low-income countries.', 'The World Bank estimated that if AMR is not addressed, by 2050 the global economy may have lost nearly 4% of annual gross domestic product (GDP) (1), with the losses being even greater in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).', 'In Canada, As such, it must be addressed through a global approach. AMR requires a coordinated One Health approach across domestic and international boundaries that results in shared solutions for an effective, comprehensive response.', 'The selection of participating infections and AMR.', 'This includes impact on AMR is not yet clear.', 'AMR is a complex global health challenge with the potential to return the world to the pre-antibiotic era, when 40% of deaths were attributable to communicable diseases.3 In order to promote a global approach to ensure prevention and continued effective treatment of infectious diseases with quality-assured, safe and effective medicines, in May 2015 the World Health Assembly adopted a global action plan on AMR.', 'Therefore, there is still much to be done. Despite real successes in some areas, compelling challenges remain. One is antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is the subject of this Global Evidence Review on Health and Migration (GEHM). AMR is a complex global health, socioeconomic and development challenge, with bacterial AMR alone causing over 1.27 million deaths per year worldwide.', 'The challenge of AMR is not insurmountable, but it remains daunting and complex. It will take global commitment and determination, strong multisectoral governance, a programmatic approach with a focus on strengthening health systems, ensuring equitable access to interventions dealing with prevention, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment, adequate financing, as well as good data and extended research in LMICs, to mitigate AMR.', 'In this study, deaths due to AMR in 2019 are estimated to average around 541 000 under a scenario similar to the OECD’s elimination scenario and around 133 000 using a scenario similar to the replacement scenario, suggesting around 25-to-21-fold difference in mortality estimates compared to the OECD estimates.', '(3) AMR is a One Health issue, meaning that it encompasses human health, animal health, plant health and the environment, and is a multi-faceted cross-border threat to health that cannot be tackled by one sector independently or by individual countries alone. Tackling AMR requires a high level of collaboration across sectors and between countries, including at global level.', 'AMR is a complex and challenging One Health issue. In order to establish a national programme on integrated surveillance, countries need key elements including holistic collaboration, involvement of key sectors and subsectors, laboratory capacity to culture, isolate, identify, and characterize the pathogens involved, and human and financial resources.', 'AMR is associated with reductions in years of life and the quality of life Under the elimination scenario, a total of 1.5 million LYs are estimated to be lost due to AMR every year up to 2050 across the 34 countries included in the analysis, corresponding to around 133 LYs per 100 000 persons (Figure 3.7).', 'Globally, the AMR burden is high and is disproportionately placed on LMICs. Regions with the highest death rates attributable to AMR are found in Africa and south Asia (4), where AMR threatens to undo years of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (5). The global cost of AMR has the potential to reachUS$ 100 trillion by 2050 (6).', 'In Malaysia, OF MyAP-AMR AMR occurs naturally over time through genetic changes. It is a global, multifactorial, and complex problem intrinsically linked to human health and behaviour but also entangled with animal health, food production, agriculture, and the environment. The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are key factors contributing to AMR, which includes inappropriate prescribing.', 'In China, It is estimated by WHO that deaths attributed to AMR will be as high as 10 million in 2050, which is even larger than the current number of deaths caused by cancer (8.2 million)3. 2.

This is followed by scaling up RDTs, increasing mass media campaigns and improving prescriber education. Increasing vaccination coverage can also help reduce mortality due to AMR.', 'In Western Pacific Region, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global issue that poses a formidable and growing threat to human health, health security and global and national economies. If unabated, AMR is predicted to cause more than 5 million cumulative deaths and a total economic cost of nearly US$ 150 billion in the Western Pacific Region from 2020 to 2030.', 'The global cost of AMR has the potential to reachUS$ 100 trillion by 2050 (6). According to this trajectory, by 2030 low income countries may lose more than 5% of their gross domestic product due to AMR and, without rapid action, an additional 24 million people in LMICs may be forced into extreme poverty (7).', 'In Norway, Antibiotikaresistens - Kunnskapshull, utfordringer og aktuelle tiltak.

Addressing the AMR problem therefore needs international collaboration.', 'AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines such as antibiotics, fungicides and other antimicrobials. As a result, infections are harder to treat and the risks of disease spread, causing the number of illness and death to increase.', 'Left unchecked, AMR has the potential to derail progress towards the Triple Billion Targets and the SDGs. AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death.', 'That means tailoring the message to focus on local and targeted risks, opportunities and potential impacts of AMR.', 'In Malaysia, (See figure below) Figure 4. National Antimicrobial Resistance Committee (NARC) Framework GENERAL OBJECTIVE To slow the emergence of AMR and prevent its spread, it is important to: (1) increase public knowledge and understanding of AMR and use of antimicrobials, particularly in those involved in healthcare, nursing care, food, and livestock production and aquaculture, (2) understand the state of AMR emergence and prevalence, and use of antimicrobials (including surveillance, monitoring and research), and to assess the risk based on the understanding of AMR and the issue (3) enhance proper infection prevention and Malaysian Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (MyAP-AMR) 2017-2021 18 control, (4) ensure appropriate use of antimicrobial in order to reduce antimicrobial- resistant organisms.', 'No single government department or independent organization can tackle it alone.
